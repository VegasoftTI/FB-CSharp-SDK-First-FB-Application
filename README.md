Facebook C# SDK - Writing your First Facebook Application
=========================================================

This sample is based on my blog post on helping developers write their first Facebook application using Facebook C# SDK.

This sample is based on the original blog post [http://blog.prabir.me/post/Facebook-CSharp-SDK-Writing-your-first-Facebook-Application.aspx](http://blog.prabir.me/post/Facebook-CSharp-SDK-Writing-your-first-Facebook-Application.aspx) and was created to sync with the latest Facebook C# SDK. It has now been updated to reflect changes in v6. Blog post for v6 on this sample can be found at [http://blog.prabir.me/post/Facebook-CSharp-SDK-Writing-your-First-Facebook-Application-v6.aspx](http://blog.prabir.me/post/Facebook-CSharp-SDK-Writing-your-First-Facebook-Application-v6.aspx). For v5, you can continue to use the "v5" branch [https://github.com/prabirshrestha/FB-CSharp-SDK-First-FB-Application/tree/v5](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/FB-CSharp-SDK-First-FB-Application/tree/v5)
